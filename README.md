# Readme

The Nacho language is a variation of the R markdown language, especially designed to make it easier to organize your notes into headings and find information quickly. It allows you to have:

* subheadings (##, ###, ####, etc.) that show up in the symbols quick panel even when they are indented.

* highlights within comments using 4 different syntaxes (Ex: # comment _highlight 1_ _highlight 2_, :highlight 3:, `highlight 4`)
